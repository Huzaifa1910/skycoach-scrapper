Selfplay (Remote)
- For some reason, Mage Tower is one of the in-game activities that are constantly monitored by developers. In order to provide the highest degree of safety for this service, so we use the Selfplay (Remote) completion method instead of the regular Selfplay method. This means that our pro-player will remotely access your account using reliable and safe remote-control software. This completion method has proven to be the safest many times, and we highly recommend using it.
We will utilize the Parsec remote control software, which is a free and very reliable solution for remote-controlled gaming. All you will need to do is install the free app on your PC and then follow the instructions of our Customer Support managers.
Our players will access only the game, not anything else on your PC.
Piloted
- This is a more traditional completion method. Our PRO players will access your account using a safe and reliable VPN service and will complete the challenge of playing on your account. Using this option, you should realize the risks of using this completion method and be ready to face possible consequences. We can guarantee 100% safety only via the Selfplay (Remote) completion method.",,"3,79 €",Timewalking & Mage Tower,https://skycoach.gg/wow-boost/timewalking-mage-tower,https://skycoach.gg/storage/uploads/products/mage-tower-challenge-boost1634552473_picture_item.png

Raid Loot options explained
Group Loot
- This loot option guarantees that you will get a chance to roll at least 2-3 items per boss. It means that whether you receive an item or not depends on your luck.
Unsaved Group Loot
- With this loot option, we will increase the number of unsaved players in the raid group to provide you with 4-6 items per boss to roll. It will significantly increase your chances of looting items; however, there are no guaranteed items with this option.
Armor Type & Token Priority
- You will be assigned to a raid (with from 10 to 26 unsaved characters) along with other clients in such a way that allows you to be the only player with your armor type. Thus, 16-24, 32-40, or 40-48 items will be dropped during a full Liberation of Undermine raid run so that you can access 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, or 5-6 gear pieces from each boss. Of course, you will loot all items of your armor type. The only items you will roll with other clients in the raid are necklaces, rings, trinkets, cloaks, and weapons. Please note that Excessively Bejeweled Curio is not guaranteed unless the Full Loot Priority option is selected.
Full Loot Priority
- If you choose this option, you will be assigned to a raid (with from 10 to 26 unsaved characters) with the exclusive right to loot any gear. This means that you will get all items suitable for your character (up to 54 items dropped in total). You will also be able to invite one or two friends to the raid so they can loot anything you do not need.",,"93,99 €",Powerleveling,https://skycoach.gg/wow-boost/powerleveling/achievements,https://skycoach.gg/storage/uploads/products/keystone-legend-free-liberation-of-undermine-heroic-bundle1747396491_picture_item.png

Mount, one of the rarest mounts in World of Warcraft;
Complete safety and fair price.
Are you fascinated by game items with intriguing stories? The
Amani Dragonhawk
is precisely what you're looking for.
While the Dragonhawk is a typical racial mount for blood elves, its unique model has a captivating history. This majestic creature endured years of enslavement within Zul’Aman, bearing witness to the cultural nuances of the Amani tribe. Upon liberation, Dragonhawks transformed into some of the most loyal mounts, featuring distinctive colors that make them highly sought-after collectibles. Acquire our WoW Amani Dragonhawk boost and establish yourself as the proud owner of this stunning beast.
It's worth noting that each new Dragonhawk model is a rare find. The majority of known blood elf mounts were introduced in the initial WoW expansions, and new variations are seldom added to the game. To ensure you don't miss the opportunity to obtain this exceptional mount, secure the
Amani Dragonhawk
service from Skycoach.

It is not an exotic pet, so you can tame it without Beast Mastery talents, but it is still pretty hard to get due to its location, immunity to hunter's traps, and stunning abilities. The other difficulty is that an over-geared character can easily one-shot the beast, and you'll have to wait 4-10 hours to make another attempt.

The Ghostcrawler is one of the few exotic spiritual beasts that can be tamed and used as a pet for your hunter.

So, any true fan of the game would be happy to have this Easter Egg in his collection.
It's not easy to tame the Ghostcrawler. Since it is an exotic pet, the hunter who wants to tame it should have the Beast Mastery talents unlocked. But that's not all the difficulties. The Ghostcrawler has a respawn time of 4-10 hours and can appear at several spots in the Abyssal Depths location with considerable walking time between them.
