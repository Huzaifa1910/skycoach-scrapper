Chosen Armor Piece with 60+ Total Stat in a chosen armor slot;
Lots of random drops during the order completion;
A lot of experience for your season pass and seasonal artifact.
About Armor Stats
Your armor's total stat allocation is divided among six different stats. Each time you receive a new armor piece, the game segregates the stats into two distinct pools:
Stat Pool One: Mobility, Resilience, Recovery;
Stat Pool Two: Discipline, Intellect, Strength.
The game evenly splits your total stat points, assigning half to each pool. For instance, if your armor has a total stat value of 60, 30 points would be allocated to Mobility, Resilience, and Recovery. The remaining 30 points would then be distributed among Discipline, Intellect, and Strength.",,"90,89 €",Leveling,https://skycoach.gg/destiny-boost/leveling,https://skycoach.gg/storage/uploads/products/highh-stat-armor1685139015_picture_item.png
