Hearthstone Mercenaries
is a series of furious battles between squads of experienced mercenaries, divided into three classes:
casters (damage and control mainly using spells),
fighters (damage using attacks),
and
protectors (control and tanking).
It’s much different from the classic gameplay and Battlegrounds, as here you’ll have to level up and equip your Mercenaries, build on your Mercenaries Camp, and complete various PVE and PVP encounters.
Of course, if you want to win renown in this game mode you will have much to learn even if you are an experienced player.
All your carefully developed lineups and strategies are useless here!
Unlike other game modes in
Hearthstone
, here you'll have not only to level up your Mercenaries but also equip them with powerful weapons. Once your Mercenary is level 30, he'll get one automatically, but to get another two weapons and therefore completely progress your Mercenary you'll have to do the quests in your
Mercenary Camp.
What you get from this Bundle:
Your mercenary up to 30 level;
All 3 weapons.
Happily, we can help you with that! Our pro-players get all the Mercenary weapons for you in no time! This offer allows you to both level up your Mercenary and gives him the best possible choice of equipment.
